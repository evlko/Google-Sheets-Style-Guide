    <h1>Google Sheets Style Guide</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a set of guidelines that can help separate entities in your tables. It can be useful to easily find the right ones and distinguish them from each other. Also, since named functions can be exported, naming them is especially important.</p>
        <p>The guide will be expanded and updated from time to time, so feel free to share, comment, and suggest improvements.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>1 Naming Rules</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>1.1 Named Ranges</h4>
        <p>Uppercase with underscores: <code>NAMED_RANGE</code>.</p>
        <p>This naming allows you to distinguish your ranges from all functions and keeps the appearance of the letters in the global space ('cause all of them are uppercase).</p>
        <h4>1.2 Coefficients</h4>
        <p>The coefficient is a named range consisting of one cell and which depends on other cells. To such a range add <code>_COEFF</code> to the end: <code>STEAM_REVENUE_COEFF</code>.</p>
        <h4>1.3 Named Functions</h4>
        <p>Uppercase starting & with underscores: <code>_NAMED_FUNCTION</code>.</p>
        <p>Named functions are worth starting with the underscore to filter them out from the standard ones. Standard functions use a dot as a separator but named functions can only have the underscore.</p>
        <h4>1.4 Function Arguments</h4>
        <p>Lowercase with underscores: <code>arg_name</code>.</p>
        <p>You can use named ranges in functions, so it's better to use a different case to distinguish between them and func args.</p>
        <h4>1.5 Sheets</h4>
        <p>PascalCase but with blanks: <code>Sheet Name</code>.</p>
        <h3>2 Sheets</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>2.1 General</h4>
        <p>Main Sheet. Contains all the necessary information about the table (purpose, what you need to know, references, color rules). It always comes first.</p>
        <h4>2.2 Coefficients</h4>
        <p>Coefficients Sheet. Contains the calculation of all possible coefficients. More about them in 1.2.</p>
        <h4>2.3 Pivot</h4>
        <p>Pivot Table. Since such a table is created on the basis of some sheet and there may be several of them. Start with <code>Pivot</code>, then the name of the base sheet, then the number: <code>Pivot Sheet Name 1</code></p>
        <h3>3 Coloring Rules</h3>
